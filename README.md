##Node class module for Mock Sensor

#####This class module should work on any Linux platform, and has been thoroughly tested on BBB

###Install

```
npm install @agilatech/mock
```
OR
```
git clone https://github.com/Agilatech/mock.git
```

###Usage
#####Load the module and create an instance
```
const driver = require('@agilatech/mock');

// create an instance 
const mock = new driver();
```
#####Get basic device info
```
const name = mock.deviceName();  // returns string with name of device
const type = mock.deviceType();  // returns string with type of device
const version = mock.deviceVersion(); // returns this software version
const active = mock.deviceActive(); // true if active, false if inactive
const numVals =  mock.deviceNumValues(); // returns the number of paramters sensed
```
####Get parameter info and values
```
// given a parameter index, these return parameter info
const paramName0 = mock.nameAtIndex(0);
const paramType0 = mock.typeAtIndex(0);
const paramVal0  = mock.valueAtIndexSync(0);
```
####Asynchronous value collection is also available
```
//valueAtIndex(index, callback)
mock.valueAtIndex(0, function(err, val) {
    if (err) {
        console.error(err);
    }
    else {
        console.log(`Asynchronous call return: ${val}`);
    }
});
```
####Watch for value changes
```
// watchValueAtIndex(index, callback)
mock.watchValueAtIndex(0, function(err, val) {
	if (!err) {
		console.log("Mock value is now : " + val);
	}
});
```
####Reset the value to 0
```
//resetValueAtIndex(index)
mock.resetValueAtIndex(0);
```

###Operation Notes
This class module is a mock sensor driver.  It is intended for testing purposes, as well as serving as a template for real drivers.  It simply generates random float numbers between 0 and 100.  It is intended for use with the Agilatech VersaLink IIoT system, but has a simple and generic enough API to be used by most anything.
